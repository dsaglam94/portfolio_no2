### imDawn - Portfolio no.2

- I am creating this portfolio to practice my skills and put together what I learned so far during my journey. 
- The design style is inspired by another portfolio I've come across.
- Normally I wasn't gonna make the source code public but I want to hear opinions and recommendations to improve my skills and refactor my code if it's necessary.

>Feel free to use any of the codes in this project.

> If you create your own custom cursor and get give it some behavior like I did. It becomes a real pain for mobile devices. So:
- Create a media query with `(pointer:coarse)` and make the custom cursor invisible from the mobile user only not to distrup.


>Tech stack used in this project:

- SASS 
- HTML5
- JavaScript 

It's not finished yet. But so far:

- Fixed the mobile device issues caused by 'custom cursor'
- Removed the unnecessary hover effects on mobile devices
- Improved the accesibilty
